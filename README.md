# Welcome to Bedotation!!
I uploaded the LaTeX files of the proof summary to be contributed by students of the next generation to better match their needs, as the proofs required changes a year to year.

Please make a new branch named with the semester (e.g., Fall-2025) and ONLY edit ```main.tex```, all other files are for the LaTeX to work. 
Please try to follow the same structure to keep the integrity and coherence of the file.
