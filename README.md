# Welcome to Bedotation!!
I uploaded the LaTeX files of the proof summary to be contributed by students of the next generation, as the proofs required changes from year to year.

# Contribution Rules: 
* Please make a new branch named with the semester (e.g., Fall-2025) and ONLY edit ```main.tex```, all other files are for the LaTeX to work. 
* Try to follow the same structure to keep the integrity and coherence of the file. 
* Your branch should only contain  ```main.tex``` and lastly the rendered PDF properly named with the semester included.
* Do not remove my name from the newer versions; instead, add the names of your contributors to the new versions, under my name in the author, you will find a comment with a placeholder to put your name.
